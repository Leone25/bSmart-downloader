Download your books from bSmart as offline pdf


## How to use

### Installation
(NOTE: this assumes you already have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/))
1. Download and extract the repo
2. Open a terminal window in the folder where you extracted the repo
3. Run `npm i` to install all the required dependencies

### Usage

1. Open a terminal window in the folder where you extracted the repo
2. Run `node index.js`
3. Open the dev tools (F12) and go to the storage(Firefox) or application(Chromium) tab, there click on `Cookie`, then `https://my.bsmart.it`, then copy in the terminal the cookie called `_bsw_session_v1_production`
4. Input the id of the book you'd like to download, either from the list or from the url, after `/books/`. It's ususally a 4 digit number
5. Press enter and the script will start working, a file will be saved in the same folder as the one with the `index.js` with the name of the book, containing the full book downloaded.

NOTE: some times this doesn't work flawlessly, i've tryed to fix all the issues I've had but in some cases you might need to do a manual download and merge, for this I've left some commented code for the techys.

Enjoy

Remember that you are sesponsible for what you are doing on the internet and even tho this script exists it might not be legal in your country to create personal backups of books.
